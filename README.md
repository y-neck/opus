# Opus

As a student, you have to work on many projects as a team. Normally, many different tools are used to manage projects, and it can be difficult to keep track of all the tasks and deadlines. Opus is a project management tool that helps you keep track of your projects and tasks in that it tries to unite as many tools as possible in one place.

When you create a new project, you can add team members and invite them to the project. You can also assign tasks to team members and set deadlines for them. Opus will then display all the tasks assigned to you and the team members in a clear and organized way. Add links to important documents and files hosted on different platforms. Supabase will take care of the database and you can access it via the web application.
