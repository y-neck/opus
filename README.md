# Opus

As a student, you have to work on many projects as a team. Normally, many different tools are used to manage projects, and it can be difficult to keep track of all the tasks and deadlines. Opus is a project management tool that helps you keep track of your projects and tasks in that it tries to unite as many tools as possible in one place.
